* If your needs are less complex, check out [[EasyScore|Using-EasyScore]] to learn about the simpler EasyScore API.
* Almost every VexFlow project begins with the same five lines of code. Check out [Understanding Renderer and Context](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/wiki/Understanding-Renderer-&-Context) to learn what they really do.
* [API Documentation](http://public.vexflow.com/build/docs/) generated from the source code. This is a work in progress.
* [[Frequently Answered Questions|The-VexFlow-FAQ]] from the VexFlow mailing list.

## Contribute

* Join the VexFlow Google Group at: https://groups.google.com/g/vexflow
* See the [coding style guide](VexFlow-Coding-Style) guide for general rules and conventions.
* Send in your changes via a GitHub pull request.
* Take a look at the [Development Gotchas](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/wiki/Development-Gotchas) if some aspects of VexFlow's internals seem confusing.
* [[Test Your Code | Tests]]. Please include tests. Changes that don't have accompanying tests will not be merged.
* Don't forget to run the [Visual Regression Tests](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/wiki/Visual-Regression-Tests) -- it is simpler, faster, and more likely to catch issues than eyeballing the output of the QUnit tests.
* If you add a new feature, update this Wiki with some documentation and examples.
