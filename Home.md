-   If your needs are less complex, check out [[EasyScore|Using-EasyScore]] to learn about the simpler EasyScore API.
-   Almost every VexFlow project begins with the same five lines of code. Check out [Understanding Renderer and Context](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/wiki/Understanding-Renderer-&-Context) to learn what they really do.
-   [API Documentation](https://0xfe.github.io/vexflow/api/) generated from the source code. This is a work in progress.
-   [Frequently Asked Questions](FAQ) from the VexFlow mailing list.
-   Experiment with the VexFlow API: [VexFlow 4 Sandbox](https://jsfiddle.net/zjgfp217/) | [VexFlow 3.0.9 Sandbox](https://jsfiddle.net/sa7nor23/)

-   See the [coding style guide](VexFlow-Coding-Style) guide for rules and conventions.
-   Send in your changes via a [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/pulls).
-   Take a look at the [Development Gotchas](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/wiki/Development-Gotchas) if some aspects of VexFlow's internals seem confusing.
-   [[Test Your Code | Testing]]. Please include tests. Changes that don't have accompanying tests will not be merged.
-   Don't forget to run the [Visual Regression Tests](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/wiki/Visual-Regression-Tests) -- it is simpler, faster, and more likely to catch issues than eyeballing the output of the QUnit tests.
-   If you add a new feature, update this Wiki with documentation and examples.
