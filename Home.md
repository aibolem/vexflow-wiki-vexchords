### Contribute

* Join the VexFlow Google Group at: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/vexflow
* Send in your changes via a GitHub pull request.
* Rebase early, rebase often.
* Please include tests -- I will not commit changes that don't have accompanying tests.
* Don't forget to run the [Visual Regression Tests](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/wiki/Visual-Regression-Tests) -- it is simpler, faster, and more likely to catch issues than eyeballing the output of the QUnit tests.
* See the [coding style guide](VexFlow-Coding-Style) guide for general rules and conventions.
* If you add a new feature, update this Wiki with some documentation and examples.
