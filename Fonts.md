# Add a Music Engraving Font

VexFlow comes with these music engraving fonts: Bravura, Petaluma, Gonville, and Custom. The first two are SMuFL fonts. Gonville was the font used by the first release of VexFlow. Custom includes glyphs that we have added over the years.

Let's walk through the process of adding a completely NEW engraving font to VexFlow. For this tutorial, we use the [Leland SMuFL font](https://github.com/MuseScoreFonts/Leland).
