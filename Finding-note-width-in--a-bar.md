I have an application where I need a piano staves. I want to generate them dynamically.
how do I have the overall width (pixels) of the notes on either stave. I get mixed results when I use voice.boundingBox.
The width it produces doesn't match the width of the nodes in the bar - after my tests. This something I need to see of the half note is given a wider width. So to speak.

My logic is probably a mile out of wake too.

Can you unravel foe me please?

Ian
