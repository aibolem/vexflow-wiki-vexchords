## What is EasyScore?

EasyScore is a tiny language that you can use to generate all the VexFlow elements necessary for a sequence of musical notation. The language supports notes, accidentals, beams, dots, tuplets, and other common notational elements.

Here's an example of an EasyScore line representing a C major chord (quarter note) followed by four eighth notes: `(C4 E4 G4)/q, D4/8, E4, F4, G4`.

## Let's Go!

### A Few Notes on a Stave [ [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/0b6hcc69/5/) ]

Below, we use `Factory`, `System`, and `EasyScore` to render four notes on a treble stave.

```javascript
// Create an SVG renderer and attach it to the DIV element named "boo".
var vf = new Vex.Flow.Factory({renderer: {selector: 'boo'}});
var score = vf.EasyScore();
var system = vf.System();
```

The factory is constructed with a `DIV` selector, and takes care of initializing the rendering context. All elements generated by the factory will be connected to this context by default. Notice that we use the factory to to generate the `EasyScore` and `System` instances too.

```javascript
system.addStave({
  voices: [score.voice(score.notes('C#5/q, B4, A4, G#4'))]
}).addClef('treble').addTimeSignature('4/4');

vf.draw();
```

We then construct a `System` and provide it a voice generated by `score`. The `addStave` call creates a new stave and renders `voices` onto the stave. The voice is constructed with `score.voice(...)`, which uses notes constructed from `score.notes(...)`, which takes an EasyScore string.

EasyScore lets you quickly write out a musical sequence and generates the appropriate VexFlow elements for you. In the string, `C#5/q, B4, A4, G#4`, we have four notes separated by commas. They're all quarter notes (as notated by the `/q` which cascades to following notes) on octaves 5 and 4. There are also two `#` accidentals generated by this score.

The `addStave(..)` call returns a normal `Vex.Flow.Stave` instance, on which the `addClef()` and `addTimeSignature()` methods were called above.

The final call to the factory, `vf.draw()`, formats and renders all elements generated by the factory (which, here, is everything.)

### Two Voices [ [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/jp4tdzv4/1/) ]

Below we add another voice with two half notes to the stave.

```javascript
system.addStave({
  voices: [
    score.voice(score.notes('C#5/q, B4, A4, G#4', {stem: 'up'})),
    score.voice(score.notes('C#4/h, C#4', {stem: 'down'}))
  ]
}).addClef('treble').addTimeSignature('4/4');
```

Above, we provided the `stem` option to `score.notes` to explicitly specify the direction of the stem for each voice.

### Multiple Voices on Multiple Staves [ [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/3d0nbL0n/2/) ]

Now, lets add another stave which renders two more voices.

```javascript
system.addStave({
  voices: [
    score.voice(score.notes('C#5/q, B4, A4, G#4', {stem: 'up'})),
    score.voice(score.notes('C#4/h, C#4', {stem: 'down'}))
  ]
}).addClef('treble').addTimeSignature('4/4');

system.addStave({
  voices: [
    score.voice(score.notes('C#3/q, B2, A2/8, B2, C#3, D3', {clef: 'bass', stem: 'up'})),
    score.voice(score.notes('C#2/h, C#2', {clef: 'bass', stem: 'down'}))
  ]
}).addClef('bass').addTimeSignature('4/4');

system.addConnector()
```

<img src="http://imgur.com/4F0R6Mz.png" width="600"/>

Notice that we had to specify the clef for the EasyScore notes. We also added a `StaveConnector` that rendered along all the staves in the system. All the voices across all the staves are properly formatted, justified, and aligned.

### Beams and Tuplets [ [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/ywa7xt7k/1/) ]

To add a beam or a tuplet, simply wrap the notes in `EasyScore.beam()` or `EasyScore.tuplet()` and concatenate it to your existing notes.

```javascript
system.addStave({
  voices: [
    score.voice(
      score.notes('C#5/q, B4')
        .concat(score.beam(score.notes('A4/8, E4, C4, D4')))
    )
  ]
}).addClef('treble').addTimeSignature('4/4');
```

The code above starts with two quarter notes followed by four eighth notes under a beam.

```javascript
system.addStave({
  voices: [
    score.voice(
      score.notes('C#5/q, B4, B4')
        .concat(
        score.tuplet(score.beam(score.notes('A4/8, E4, C4'))))
    )
  ]
}).addClef('treble').addTimeSignature('4/4');
```

<img src="http://imgur.com/ICEYSX7.png" width="600"/>

And here, we wrap a beam in a tuplet to render eighth-note triplets.

## Other EasyScore Features

### Rests
Append `/r` to the note, e.g., `B4/8/r` will render an 8th note rest on the staff line for B4

### Dotted Notes
To create a dotted note, simply append one or more periods to the note, e.g., `A5/q..` which renders a quarter note with two dots.

### Chords
To create a chord, simply place multiple notes in between parenthesis, e.g., `(C4 E4 G4)/q, A5` renders a `C-major` chord followed by an `A` note.

### Note Options
You set `key=value` attributes on notes by placing the key/value pairs within brackets after the note, e.g., `A5[stem="up",id="foobar"]` will set the ID of this note to `foobar` and render it with an upwards stem.
